# Movie Trailer Website
The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a 
list of movie titles along with links to each movie's poster image and trailer
video. The data is served as a web page displaying each movie's poster. Users 
can watch each movie's trailer by clicking on the relevant poster image.

### Included files
The project consists of the following Python files:
1. **entertainment_center.py** - contains movie data; the main file for the project
2. **media.py** - contains the definition of a class to store movie data
3. **fresh_tomatoes.py** - code to build a website and render it in a browser

### Rendering the website
To render the movie website:
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/), if it is not already installed
2. Save all three Python files in the same folder
3. Run the **entertainment_centre.py** file
